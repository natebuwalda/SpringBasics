SpringBasics
============

This is the code base that was used for some of the demos in the Using Spring presentation given at the October 2013 CIJUG meeting.  It shows how to do the three different kinds of Spring configuration.  The project depends on an installation of H2 database being available on your machine.  The contexts can be tested by running any of the three Starter classes.

The presentation itself is also available in the repository.
